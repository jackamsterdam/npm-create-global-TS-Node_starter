Use this global npm package to create a starter file for working with Typescript in Nodejs.

Open an EMPTY folder and...

Type this command in the terminal:


and then: npm i

And that is it! Your are ready to go :)


Explanation:

This will automatically create a package.json file with basic settings, a tsconfig.json file with basic JSON compilerOptions, and a src folder with an empty app.ts file.

Make sure you have these packages already installed on your computer:

npm i -g typescript

npm i -g ts-node

npm i -g nodemon

No need to install npm i @types/node -D, because it is a dev dependency and it will be automatically installed with npm i.

Thanks for using,
