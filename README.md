# Package that I made and published in NPM: 
## This is mainly a template that I made to start a new TypeScript session using a npm package and one command to create all files.
## Please contact me if you used my template and enjoyed it - Linkedin: **https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-amsterdam/**
### If you are interested in a template with React or Angular, then please see my other templates.

Use this global npm package to create a starter file for working with Typescript in Nodejs.

Open your terminal and install my package globally: 
npm i -g typescript-for-nodejs-template-by-captain-jack

Open an EMPTY folder and...

Type this command in the terminal after you globally installed the package:

**create-ts-node-starter-by-captain-jack**

and then type: **npm i**

And that is it! Your are ready to go :)

Explanation:

This will automatically create a package.json file with basic settings, a tsconfig.json file with basic JSON compilerOptions, and a src folder with an empty app.ts file.

Make sure you have these packages already installed on your computer:

npm i -g typescript

npm i -g ts-node

npm i -g nodemon

No need to install npm i @types/node -D, because it is a dev dependency and it will be automatically installed with npm i.

Thanks for using,

Jack Amsterdam
